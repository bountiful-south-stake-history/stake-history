          <p>
            The Bountiful Utah South Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized on April 20, 1958, from the Bountiful and South Davis stakes. The stake was divided on January 10, 1971, to form the Bountiful Center Stake (later renamed the Bountiful Utah Central Stake), establishing the current boundaries. The stake center was dedicated on October 17, 1971.
